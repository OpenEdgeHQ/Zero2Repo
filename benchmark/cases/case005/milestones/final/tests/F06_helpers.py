"""Observation helpers for half-duplex connection shutdown.

Helpers classify send / feed / pull of a connection-closed event. They
never return a sentinel to mean the observation could not be
classified. A failed send is never rewritten as "no bytes". A failed
or need-data pull is never rewritten as connection-closed. A host or
target that cannot form a complete GET raises; a truncated prefix is
never returned as if it were a complete request.
