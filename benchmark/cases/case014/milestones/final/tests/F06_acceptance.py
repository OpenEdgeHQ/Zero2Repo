# feature: F06
"""Standalone ARS and AHRS attitude (FP-06).

Assertions stay at the PRD's precision: ARS yaw free-integrates the
bias-corrected z-rate even when a magnetometer is present; AHRS yaw is
pulled toward the magnetic (or true-north) reference without tilting
roll/pitch; the named 10 s static scenario meets 0.2° / 0.1 °/s;
supplying a geographic position steps published yaw by the WMM
declination without jumping the gyro-bias estimate; the leveling helper
on (0, 0, −g) is near zero and distinguishable from a tilted sample;
standalone init refuses a non-positive mandatory standard deviation or a
non-finite initial attitude and accepts a zero attitude; non-finite IMU
samples drop the epoch, non-finite magnetometer samples are ignored;
backwards time skips that epoch; a forward gap larger than 0.2 s skips
attitude integration; unusable fields skip heading fusion; the optional
field-strength gate downweights rather than drops; suite ARS starts on
IMU alone with yaw 0 unless a known heading was supplied, and suite AHRS
waits for the first magnetometer sample. Once the watchdog warm-up has
elapsed, a reported attitude 1-sigma above its documented threshold
(10 deg roll/pitch, 90 deg AHRS yaw by default, or the configured value)
fails attitude accessors, the suite re-bootstraps on the next suitable
epoch, and a standalone instance stays unpublished until the caller
re-inits; when that happens is read from the implementation's own
reported 1-sigma, not from assumed noise tuning. Message text, exception
types, internal mode spellings, unpublished fusion periods, and default
noise tuning are not pinned.
