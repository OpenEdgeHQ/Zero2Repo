"""Observation helpers for the membundle search command and membundle_search tool (FP-04).

Helpers raise ``HarnessError`` when a query cannot be classified, and
``AssertionError`` when a classified observation misses a carrier the
tests require. They never return ``None`` / ``{}`` / ``""`` / ``[]`` to
