# feature: F00
"""Shared machinery for driving the product through its public surface.

Suites import from this module (``from _harness import ...``). Importing it
performs no I/O, starts no processes, and opens no sockets. Stream capture,
environment replacement, and cwd changes happen only when a caller invokes
a function or enters a context manager below.

The product is an importable Python library. Authors construct clips,
transform them, and encode or decode media files through the public
root exports. It is not a command-line editor and has no socket. This
module is the one canonical way to reach that surface. It does not
import the product and does not know what any feature expects.

Surfaces
--------
* Library call — :func:`call` runs a caller-supplied public callable
  (imported by the suite from the package root) with caller-controlled
  arguments, stdin, environment, and working directory. A product
  exception is a classified outcome on :class:`CallResult`, not a
  harness failure.
* Child interpreter — :func:`run_python` / :func:`run_command` for
  observations that must bind process state **before import**: encoder
  binary selection (process environment or a dotenv file in the working
  directory), the media-encoder negative control (PATH binary removed
  and the bundled binary made unusable), and the library-substrate
  negative control (package removed from the import path).

Encoder configuration is resolved when the library is first imported.
Changing the process environment after import does not rewrite that
choice. Suites that need a different encoder, or that need the encoder
to be unreachable, must use :func:`run_python` so the child binds the
environment before the import.

Each isolated call starts from a whitelist of substrate environment
keys. Encoder-selection variables inherited from the parent are dropped
so a host setting cannot fill a condition the suite did not name.

A failure this module cannot classify raises :class:`HarnessError`.
