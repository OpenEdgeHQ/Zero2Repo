"""Cost of a trial's token usage from the bundled list-price table.

``model_pricing.json`` holds per-1M-token prices for the evaluated models.
A model string such as ``commonstack/claude-opus-5-5-20260921`` or
``grok-4.7-high`` is matched by its last path segment, with any date suffix
and reasoning-effort suffix removed, against each entry's aliases. The
unstripped leaf is also tried, so a model whose name itself ends in ``-max``
(``qwen3.8-max``) still matches.
An entry's ``currency`` is ``USD`` when omitted. Yuan prices stay in
``cost_cny`` and are not folded into ``cost_usd``.

``cache_write_1h_tokens`` is the part of ``cache_write_tokens`` written with a
one-hour TTL; it uses ``cache_write_1h_per_m`` when the model has one.
``uncached_input_is_cache_write`` marks models whose provider caches every
eligible prompt automatically and bills the write: when the log reports no
cache writes, uncached input is priced as cache writes.
``cache_read_5m_per_m`` records an explicit 5-minute cache-read rate. Trial
logs have one cache-read bucket, so those tokens use ``cache_read_per_m``.
