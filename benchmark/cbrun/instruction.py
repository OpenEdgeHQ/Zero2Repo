"""Agent instruction assembly for cbrun.

The prompt states only what the benchmark defines: the context the agent has,
what it must build, what it must not do, how to submit, and how it is scored.
It does not prescribe a way of working. Nothing about the hidden acceptance
tests leaks. Specification bodies (PRD, Interface Contract, optional hardware)
stay on disk at fixed container paths; the prompt only names those paths so it
stays well under the Linux per-argument size limit.

## Context

* Workspace: `{WORKSPACE_CONTAINER_PATH}`, your current working directory. It starts empty.
* Specification: the PRD at `{PRD_CONTAINER_PATH}` and the Interface Contract at
  `{CONTRACT_CONTAINER_PATH}`.
{hardware_line}* Language runtimes and dependencies the project needs are installed.
* The only limit is a wall-clock time budget for the whole session.
* GitHub and other code-hosting sites are not reachable from this environment.

## Rules

* The product behavior must be your own code. Do not download, clone, vendor,
  copy, or install an existing implementation of the product (for example via
  `pip install`, `npm install`, or `cargo add`). General-purpose libraries and
  tools are allowed.
* Do not use a runtime- or toolchain-bundled implementation of the same kind of
  product as a dependency or an oracle.
* Hidden acceptance tests are not in this container. Do not look for them and
  do not special-case any test.

## Submit

* Write exactly one line to `{CONTAINER_SUBMIT_PATH}`: `{SUBMIT_TOKEN}`.
* Ending the session is not a submission. Without a valid submit file this
  attempt fails and the hidden tests do not run.

## Scoring

* After a valid submit, the hidden acceptance tests run against your final
  `{WORKSPACE_CONTAINER_PATH}` and give a binary pass/fail reward.
