"""Step abstraction for cbrun (architecture stub for multi-step cases).

cbrun currently treats each case as a single final acceptance suite. It
normalizes that shape into exactly one :class:`Step` and exposes
:func:`discover_steps` so multi-step support can be added later without
touching the run/judge/results code.
